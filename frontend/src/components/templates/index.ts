/**
 * Atomic Design: TEMPLATES
 * 
 * Templates are page-level components that provide the layout
 * structure and wireframe for pages. They combine organisms,
 * molecules, and atoms into complete page layouts.
 * 
 * Templates are not used directly in production; instead,
 * pages (in the pages/ directory) inherit from templates
 * and provide actual content.
 * 
 * Examples:
 * - LandingTemplate (hero + CTA sections)
 * - DashboardTemplate (sidebar + content area)
 * - AuthTemplate (centered form layout)
 * - RitualTemplate (full ritual process layout)
 * 
 * Key characteristics:
 * - Provide layout structure
 * - Contain multiple sections/regions
 * - Used as parent components for pages
 * - Often have named slots for content
