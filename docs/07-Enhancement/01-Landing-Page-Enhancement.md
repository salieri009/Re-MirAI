## Blonix Guidelines (Anime Sub-Culture + Simple Copy)

Following Blonix's direction, the landing experience now adheres to the following:

1. **Ultra-short copy:** Every block uses one headline + one short sentence. No paragraphs, no walls of text.
2. **Anime sub-culture vibe:** Microcopy references "ritual", "echoes", "summon", and "mirror" to reinforce the anime/service fantasy.
3. **Visual-first storytelling:** Mirror animation + persona preview carry the narrative; text only labels what's happening.
4. **Flow clarity:** Each section has a single intent (Value → Steps → CTA). No secondary buttons, no side quests.

These guidelines are reflected in `InteractiveHero.tsx` and `FeatureShowcase.tsx`, keeping the experience fast, readable, and on-theme.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Core Concept:** **"The Magical Mirror"** — A mystical interface that reveals how others perceive you (*"Who do others believe I am?"*).

**Objective:** Design a multi-page interface where each page emphasizes its unique purpose and enhances the user experience aligned with that purpose.

**Core Principles:**
- **Core Purpose:** **Discovery & Conversion** (Transform curiosity into commitment).
- **Tailored UX:** Highlight visuals and interactive storytelling (Discovery) while reducing friction and emphasizing trust signals (Conversion).
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Hero section dominates to capture attention immediately; clear path to CTA.
- **Immersive Consistency:** Establish the "magical" brand atmosphere that persists throughout the journey.
- **Micro-Interactions:** Use hover effects and scroll triggers to reward curiosity and maintain engagement.
- **Emotional Resonance:** Evoke **Curiosity** and **Wonder** to drive the desire to sign up.
- **Visual Identity:** Adheres to the **Small Switch Palette** (see `09-Color-Palette-Plan.md`) to ensure brand consistency and accessibility.

---

## Executive Summary

The Landing Page is Re:MirAI's primary entry point. This enhancement plan focuses on creating an **interactive Hero section** that embodies the project's core concept ("Who do others believe I am?") while maintaining strict compliance with Nielsen's Heuristics and Blonix Branch design principles.

### Minimal Copy & Subculture Styling
- **Single-message screens:** Each fold keeps to a headline, one supporting sentence, and a single CTA—no extra body paragraphs.
- **Anime/Subculture tone:** Copy leans into short, emotive phrases and emoji or glyph accents (✨, 🔮) that mirror anime UI beats.
- **Character-first visuals:** Layouts reserve more space for persona art/mirror preview than text blocks, reinforcing the “anime service” promise.
- **Consistent microcopy:** All buttons and helper text stay under 30 characters and always reference the “mirror / echoes / persona” vocabulary.
- **Documentation rule:** Future enhancements must cite this section to keep every page lightweight and in-universe.

## Phase 1.6 Implementation Addendum (v1.0.3) - KickoffLabs Compliance

### Current Build Snapshot
- `InteractiveHero` (`frontend/src/components/organisms/InteractiveHero.tsx`) delivers GSAP-driven mirror, persona preview, hover states, and reduced-motion guardrails.
- `FeatureShowcase` (`frontend/src/components/organisms/FeatureShowcase.tsx`) provides three-step walkthrough with trust badges.
- Landing route (`frontend/src/app/page.tsx`) includes minimal header navigation per KickoffLabs requirement #9.
- All 12 KickoffLabs requirements implemented and verified.

### Key Updates (v1.0.3)
1. **Clear Offer Statement**: Updated headline to "Discover How Your Friends Actually See You" with explicit value proposition.
2. **Single Clear CTA**: Changed to "Create Your AI Mirror (Free)" with trust signals directly below.
3. **Minimal Navigation**: Added sticky header with logo and login link only (no complex menus).
4. **Trust Signals**: Added "Free to start • Anonymous feedback guaranteed • No credit card required" below CTA.
5. **Simplified Copy**: Removed secondary CTA buttons, focused on single conversion path.
6. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced responsive design for mobile-first approach.

### Compliance Verification

### Page Purpose: **DISCOVERY + CONVERSION**

**Core Intent:** Users land here to:
1. **DISCOVER:** Understand the "Mirror" concept through interactive storytelling.
2. **CONVERT:** Feel intrigued enough to start their journey immediately.

### Page Purpose: **CONVERT**

**Core Intent:** Transform curiosity into commitment—intrigue visitors and drive sign-ups.

**Unique Experience:** Interactive mirror animation reveals persona concept before signup, creating immediate value demonstration.

**Emotional Journey:** Curiosity → Intrigue → Wonder → Commitment

**Primary Goal:** Click "Summon Your Reflection" (CTA)

**How This Differs From Other Pages:**
- **vs. Login:** Not enabling—converting visitors to users

## Purpose-Driven UX Design

### Visual Hierarchy for Conversion

**Primary Focus (Z-Index 50):**
- **Interactive Mirror** - Central hero element that demands attention
- **CTA Button** - Glowing, pulsing "Summon Your Reflection" button
- **Trust Signals** - Subtle but visible (100% Anonymous, Free Forever)

**Secondary Focus (Z-Index 30):**
- **Headline** - "Who do others believe I am?" - Large, gradient text
- **Subtext** - "Discover your reflection through AI" - Supporting context

**Tertiary Focus (Z-Index 10):**
- **How It Works** - Scroll-triggered section with animated steps
- **Social Proof** - Trust badges and testimonials (if applicable)

### Micro-Interactions That Reinforce Purpose

**1. Mirror Hover State (Curiosity)**
- **Purpose:** Invite exploration without commitment
- **Interaction:** Gentle lift (translateY: -4px), glow intensifies
- **Feedback:** Ripple effect appears, text changes to "Who am I?"
- **Emotion:** Curiosity → Intrigue

**2. Mirror Click State (Engagement)**
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate value through preview
- **Interaction:** Mirror shatters, persona preview reveals
- **Feedback:** Particle effects, smooth reveal animation
- **Emotion:** Intrigue → Wonder

**3. CTA Button (Commitment)**
- **Purpose:** Convert wonder into action
- **Interaction:** Continuous glow pulse, hover scale
- **Feedback:** Button brightens on hover, smooth navigation
- **Emotion:** Wonder → Commitment

**4. Scroll-Triggered Animations (Trust Building)**
- **Purpose:** Maintain engagement as user scrolls
- **Interaction:** Steps animate in sequence on scroll
- **Feedback:** Each step fades in with slight delay
- **Emotion:** Sustained interest → Confidence

### Emotional Resonance Strategy

**Curiosity Phase (0-2s):**
- **Visual:** Floating particles, gentle mirror pulse
- **Copy:** "Who do others believe I am?"
- **Action:** User notices mirror, hovers

**Intrigue Phase (2-5s):**
- **Visual:** Mirror responds to hover, ripple effects
- **Copy:** "Who am I?" appears in mirror
- **Action:** User clicks mirror

**Wonder Phase (5-8s):**
- **Visual:** Persona preview reveals, magical animation
- **Copy:** "This could be you" with persona stats
- **Action:** User sees value, CTA becomes prominent

**Commitment Phase (8s+):**
- **Visual:** CTA glows, trust signals visible
- **Copy:** "Summon Your Reflection"
- **Action:** User clicks CTA, navigates to login

### Visual Patterns for Conversion

**Layout Strategy:**
- **Hero-Dominant:** 80% viewport height for hero section
- **Minimal Text:** Headline + subtext only (no walls of text)
- **Single CTA:** One primary action button
- **Progressive Disclosure:** "How It Works" below fold

**Color Strategy:**
- **Primary (Fuchsia):** CTA button, mirror glow, accents
- **Gradient Background:** Creates depth and magic

## Detailed UX/UI Weakness Analysis

| Weakness | UX Impact | UI Manifestation |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Static Hero** | Fails to capture attention; high bounce risk. | Static image/text header. No reaction to mouse movement. |
| **Low Immersion** | Brand promise ("Magic") feels hollow. | Flat background colors. Standard web typography. Lack of depth/layers. |
| **Delayed Value** | High friction; users leave before understanding. | "Sign Up" is the only way to see the product. No "Try it now" demo. |
| **Passive Experience** | Low engagement; users skim and leave. | Long blocks of text. Static cards. No hover rewards. |

---

## Enhancement Goals & Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Interactive Hero (Mitigates: Static Hero)
**Goal:** Create an engaging "Mirror" experience.
**Strategy:**
- **Mouse Tracking:** Implement the `InteractiveHero` component (already built) that uses GSAP to track mouse movement and create a "parallax reflection" effect.
- **Particle System:** Use `micro-interactions.ts` to generate a subtle "dust mote" field that reacts to the cursor, simulating a magical atmosphere.

### 2. Immersive Atmosphere (Mitigates: Low Immersion)
**Goal:** Establish the "magical" brand feel immediately.
**Strategy:**
- **Scroll Animations:** Use `framer-motion` or GSAP ScrollTrigger to reveal elements with a "fade-up and float" effect as the user scrolls.
- **Depth Effects:** Layer background elements (blurred orbs, gradients) to create a sense of 3D space.

### 3. Immediate Value (Mitigates: Delayed Value)
**Goal:** Demonstrate core value upfront.
**Strategy:**
- **Live Preview:** Add a "Persona Preview" card in the Hero section that cycles through example personas (e.g., "The Sage", "The Warrior") to show what the user will get.
- **Micro-Demo:** Allow users to answer *one* question (e.g., "What is your quest?") and see a mock persona result immediately.

### 4. Active Engagement (Mitigates: Passive Experience)
**Goal:** Trigger curiosity and wonder.
**Strategy:**
- **Tilt Cards:** Implement 3D tilt effects on feature cards (using `vanilla-tilt` or similar logic) to make them feel tactile.
- **Hover Rewards:** Ensure every interactive element provides immediate visual feedback (glow, scale, sound) on hover.

### Success Metrics
- **Engagement Time:** Increase average time on page by 40%
- **Scroll Depth:** 80% of users reach "How It Works" section
- **CTA Click Rate:** Increase from baseline by 25%
- **Bounce Rate:** Reduce by 20%

---

## UX Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Motion Sensitivity (Accessibility)
**Risk:** Heavy particle effects and scroll-jacking can cause motion sickness.
**Mitigation:**
- **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:** Automatically disable particles and parallax if system setting is on.
- **Static Fallback:** Provide a high-quality static image version of the Hero that still conveys the "Mirror" concept without movement.

### 2. Performance Degradation (Technical)
**Risk:** WebGL/Canvas effects may lag on low-end mobile devices.
**Mitigation:**
- **Performance Tiers:** Detect device capability (FPS check) on load.
  - **High:** Full particles + 3D tilt.
  - **Low:** Static background + simple CSS fade.
- **Battery Saver:** Disable loop animations when device is in low-power mode.

## Interactive Hero Design

### Concept: "The Mirror Experience"

**Core Interaction:** Users can interact with a "mirror" that reflects their persona concept.

**Emotional Journey:** Curiosity → Intrigue → Wonder → Commitment

### Depth & Layering Strategy

**Z-Axis Composition (Front to Back):**
```css
z-50: Primary CTA ("Summon" button) + hover glow
z-40: Mirror glass surface + interaction effects
z-30: Mirror frame + subtle shadow
z-20: Floating particle system (canvas)
z-10: Ambient gradient animation (15s loop)
z-0:  Base page background
```

**Shadow Progression (Emotional States):**
- **Default (Calm):** `box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(217, 70, 239, 0.2)`
- **Hover (Curious):** `box-shadow: 0 0 60px rgba(217, 70, 239, 0.4), 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)`
- **Active (Engaged):** `box-shadow: 0 0 80px rgba(217, 70, 239, 0.6), inset 0 0 60px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`

### Component Structure (Atomic Design)

```
organisms/
└── InteractiveHero/
    ├── InteractiveHero.tsx          # Main organism
    ├── InteractiveHero.module.css
    ├── MirrorCanvas/                # Sub-organism

        ├── PersonaPreview.tsx
        └── PersonaPreview.module.css
```

### Interaction Flow with Emotional Progression

#### State 1: Default (CURIOSITY) - 0s
**Visual:**
- Large mirror element with glassmorphism (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1), blur(20px))
- Floating ambient particles (30 max, slow drift)
- Background: Animated gradient (purple-pink, 15s cycle)

**Typography:**
- Primary: "Who do others believe I am?" (Poppins, 48px, fade-in)
- Secondary: "Discover your reflection through AI" (Inter, 18px, 0.3s delay)

**Animation:**
```css
@keyframes gentle-pulse {
  0%, 100% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 40px rgba(217, 70, 239, 0.2);
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 60px rgba(217, 70, 239, 0.3);
    transform: scale(1.01);
  }
}
animation: gentle-pulse 4s ease-in-out infinite;
```

#### State 2: Hover (INTRIGUE) - User proximity
**Visual:**
- Mirror surface ripples follow cursor (displacement map)
- Particle count increases to 50, accelerates toward cursor
- Border glow intensifies (0.3 → 0.6 opacity)

**Micro-Interaction:**
```javascript
// Cursor tracking with smooth follow
mirror.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
  const { offsetX, offsetY } = e;
  const centerX = mirror.clientWidth / 2;
  const centerY = mirror.clientHeight / 2;
  
  // Calculate displacement
  const displaceX = (offsetX - centerX) / centerX;
  const displaceY = (offsetY - centerY) / centerY;
  
  // Apply ripple effect
  mirror.style.filter = `
    blur(0) 
    hue-rotate(${displaceX * 10}deg)
  `;
  mirror.style.transform = `
    perspective(1000px)
    rotateY(${displaceX * 5}deg)
    rotateX(${-displaceY * 5}deg)
  `;
});
```

**Text Transition:**
"Discover your reflection..." (cross-fade, 0.5s)

#### State 3: Click/Active (WONDER) - User engagement
**Animation Sequence (3.2s total):**
```
0.0s → Mirror shake (0.3s, intensity: 5px)
0.3s → Cracks appear from center (0.5s, SVG path animation)
0.8s → Fragments scatter (0.6s, each fragment random trajectory)
1.4s → Persona preview fades in from behind (0.8s, scale 0.8 → 1.0)
2.2s → Persona details cascade in (1.0s, stagger: 0.1s each)
   - Name
   - Archetype badge
   - Stats bars (animated fill)
   - Rarity glow
```

**Code Implementation:**
```typescript
async function triggerMirrorTransform() {
  const timeline = gsap.timeline();
  
  // Shake
  timeline.to('.mirror', {
    x: '+=5',
    yoyo: true,
    repeat: 5,
    duration: 0.05
  });
  
  // Shatter
  timeline.to('.mirror-crack', {
    strokeDashoffset: 0,
    duration: 0.5,
    ease: 'power2.out'
  }, '+=0.3');
  
  // Scatter fragments
  timeline.to('.mirror-fragment', {
    x: (i) => gsap.utils.random(-300, 300),
    y: (i) => gsap.utils.random(-300, 300),
    rotation: (i) => gsap.utils.random(-180, 180),
    opacity: 0,
    duration: 0.6,
    stagger: 0.02,
    ease: 'power3.out'
  });
  
  // Reveal persona
  timeline.fromTo('.persona-preview',
    { scale: 0.8, opacity: 0, y: 50 },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: 0.8, ease: 'back.out(1.4)' }
  );
  
  // Cascade details
  timeline.from('.persona-detail', {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 20,
    duration: 0.3,
    stagger: 0.1,
    ease: 'power2.out'
  });
  
  // Play sound (optional)
  playSound('/sounds/mirror-shatter.mp3', 0.3);
}
```

**Text:** "This could be you" (fade-in, mysterious font)

**CTA Appearance:**
```css
.cta-summon {
  animation: cta-glow 2s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes cta-glow {
  0%, 100% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(217, 70, 239, 0.5);
  }
  50% { 
    box-shadow: 0 0 50px rgba(217, 70, 239, 0.8), 0 0 80px rgba(240, 147, 251, 0.4);
  }
}
```

#### State 4: Scroll Trigger (TRANSITION) - Natural progression
**Behavior:**
- Persona preview smoothly scales down (1.0 → 0.6) as user scrolls
- Opacity fades (1.0 → 0.3)
- Parallax effect: Moves slower than scroll speed (0.5x)
- Crosses into "How It Works" section

**Implementation:**
```javascript
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const scrolled = window.scrollY;
  const heroHeight = heroSection.clientHeight;
  const progress = Math.min(scrolled / heroHeight, 1);
  
  personaPreview.style.transform = `
    scale(${1 - progress * 0.4})
    translateY(${scrolled * 0.5}px)
  `;
  personaPreview.style.opacity = 1 - progress * 0.7;
});
```

### Technical Implementation

**Technologies:**
- **Three.js** or **Canvas API** for mirror effect
- **GSAP** or **Framer Motion** for animations
- **React Spring** for smooth transitions

**Performance Considerations:**
- Lazy load heavy animations
- Use CSS transforms for GPU acceleration
- Reduce particle count on mobile devices

## Performance Optimization

### Loading Strategy
1. **Critical CSS:** Inline hero styles
2. **Lazy Load:** Defer non-critical animations
3. **Code Splitting:** Separate interactive hero bundle
4. **Image Optimization:** WebP format, responsive sizes

### Animation Performance
- Use `transform` and `opacity` only
- Leverage GPU acceleration
- Limit repaints/reflows
- Use `will-change` sparingly

### Bundle Size
- Target: <50KB for hero component
- Tree-shake unused animations
- Dynamic imports for heavy libraries
