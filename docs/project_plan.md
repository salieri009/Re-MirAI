# Project Plan: Persona AI

## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the project plan for "Persona AI," a web application designed to create a unique AI chatbot persona for a user, based on collective feedback from their friends. The core idea is to provide a fun and shareable answer to the question, "How do others see me?" by generating an interactive AI that reflects a user's personality from their friends' perspective. The platform will feature a distinct anime-inspired aesthetic, focusing on a simple, engaging, and highly viral user experience.

## 2. Goals

*   **Primary Goal:** To create a simple, engaging, and highly shareable experience where users can discover and interact with an AI representation of their public persona.
*   **Secondary Goals:**
    *   Achieve viral growth through an intuitive social sharing loop.
    *   Establish a platform for unique AI-driven social interactions, presented with a cohesive anime theme.
    *   Explore viable monetization strategies through premium features.

## 3. Target Audience

*   **Primary:** Teenagers and young adults (10s-20s) who are active on social media, interested in personality trends (like MBTI), and enjoy anime, webtoons, and gaming subcultures.
*   **Secondary:** Writers, creators, and role-players looking for tools to build and define characters with an anime aesthetic.

## 4. Core Features

### 4.1. The Viral Loop: Profile Creation & Sharing

The user flow is designed around a core viral loop, ensuring that most new users are acquired through friend invitations rather than a landing page.

1.  **Entry Point A (The Creator):**
    *   An existing user creates a "Profile Analysis" link.
    *   The user shares this unique link with their friends on social media.

2.  **Entry Point B (The Friend/New User):**
    *   A new user clicks the shared link to help their friend.
    *   They answer a series of fun, engaging questions about their friend's personality. The interface is clean, simple, and mobile-first.
    *   After submitting their feedback, they are shown a snippet of the result they contributed to.
    *   **The Viral Hook:** They are immediately prompted to create their own "Profile Analysis" link to discover how *their* friends see them, kicking off a new loop.

3.  **Profile Generation:**
    *   Once a sufficient number of friends have responded, the system aggregates the feedback.
    *   It synthesizes the data into a detailed persona profile, which forms the basis for the AI model.
    *   The original user is notified that their AI Persona is ready.

4.  **AI Chatbot Interaction:**
    *   An AI chatbot is generated based on the synthesized persona.
    *   The user can interact with their AI, seeing their friends' collective perception of them come to life.

### 4.2. Interaction & Visualization

*   **Chat Interface:** A clean, modern chat screen for talking to the generated AI persona, designed for intuitive mobile use.
*   **AI-Generated Avatar:** An AI-generated, anime-style character avatar representing the persona. This will be a key visual and shareable element.
*   **Gender Toggle:** A feature to see a gender-swapped version of the persona's avatar and potentially its communication style.

### 4.3. Social & Gamification

*   **Friendship Chemistry:** Users can see a "chemistry score" between their persona and a friend's persona, presented in a fun, shareable format.
*   **Simple Profiles:** Users can choose to keep their persona private or share a simple, visually appealing profile card with friends on the platform.

## 5. Monetization Strategy

The service will be free to use, with revenue generated through premium features:

*   **"Premium Persona" Package:**
    *   Advanced, more detailed, and higher-quality anime-style character avatar.
    *   Access to more sophisticated personality analysis and reports.
    *   Unlock special interaction modes with the chatbot (e.g., "counselor mode," "debate mode").
*   **"Friend Persona" Access:** A time-limited pass (e.g., "1-week rental") allowing a user to interact with a friend's public persona chatbot.
*   **Chemistry Reports:** While a basic score is free, a detailed chemistry report explaining the dynamics between two personas could be a paid feature.
*   **Ad-Free Experience:** A subscription option to remove in-app advertisements.

## 6. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

The goal of the MVP is to validate the core viral loop with minimal development effort.

*   **Features:**
    *   User registration (simplified, potentially after completing a friend's survey).
    *   Simple survey generation and sharing.
    *   Collection of survey responses.
    *   The core viral hook prompting survey-takers to create their own account.
    *   Basic persona synthesis and generation.
    *   A functional chat interface to talk to the generated persona.
*   **Omissions for MVP:**
    *   No AI-generated avatars (placeholders with a basic anime aesthetic will be used).
    *   No gender toggle.
    *   No friendship chemistry features.
    *   No monetization features.

## 7. Future Enhancements

*   **Context-Specific Profiles:** Allow survey-takers to specify their relationship (e.g., family, coworker, close friend) to generate context-specific personas (e.g., "Work Persona" vs. "Friend Persona").
*   **Advanced Avatars:** Partner with an image generation AI service specializing in anime styles to create high-quality, customizable character art.
*   **Group Profiles:** Create a "group profile" based on feedback from a whole team or circle of friends.
*   **Gamified Scenarios:** Place the AI persona in randomly generated scenarios and let the user see how it would respond, creating more shareable content.
*   **Integration with Other Platforms:** Allow exporting personas for use in other applications (e.g., VRChat, character AI platforms).
