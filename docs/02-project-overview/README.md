## What is Re:MirAI?

Re:MirAI is an AI-powered personality discovery platform that answers the question: **"How do others see me?"**

By collecting anonymous feedback from friends through shareable surveys (called "Rituals"), Re:MirAI synthesizes a unique AI persona that reflects your external personality—creating an interactive chatbot you can engage with to explore the gap between self-perception and how others perceive you.
