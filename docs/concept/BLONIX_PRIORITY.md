# Blonix Branch Priority - Design Philosophy

## Overview

This document establishes **Blonix Branch design philosophy as the top priority** for the Re:MirAI project. All design decisions, documentation, and implementation should align with this philosophy.

## Core Principles

### 1. Light Theme First
- **Background:** `#f8fafc` (light gray)
- **Cards:** `#ffffff` (white)
- **Text:** `#0f172a` (dark gray) for primary, `#64748b` for secondary
- **Rationale:** Optimized for daytime use, accessibility, and broad appeal

### 2. Modern Color System
- **Primary:** Fuchsia/Pink (`#d946ef`) - Fresh, contemporary, energetic
- **Secondary:** Blue (`#3b82f6`) - Trustworthy, professional, clean
- **Rationale:** Appeals to general users, not requiring subculture knowledge

### 3. Typography
- **Font Family:** Inter + Poppins
- **Rationale:** Friendly, modern feel that's approachable to all users

### 4. Accessibility Priority
- **High Contrast:** WCAG AA compliant
- **Readability:** Optimized for all lighting conditions
- **Inclusivity:** Welcoming to users of all backgrounds
